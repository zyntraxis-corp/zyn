# Project Structure

Generated project layout:
```
project/
├── .zyn/
│   ├── deps/      # Downloaded dependencies
│   ├── build/     # Dependency build outputs
│   └── lock/      # Version lock files
├── src/           # Source files
├── include/       # Headers
└── zyn.toml       # Project configuration
```

# Configuration (zyn.toml)

Example configuration:
```toml
[project]
name = "my_app"
version = "1.0.0"
language = "cpp"
standard = "c++20"
compiler = "clang++"

[directories]
sources = "src"
include = "include"
build = ".zyn/build"

[dependencies]
fmt = { git = "https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt.git", tag = "9.1.0" }
boost = { path = "/opt/boost" }

[libraries]
lib_dirs = ["/usr/local/lib/build"]
libraries = ["pthread", "dl"]
```

# Dependency Management

## Git Dependencies
```toml
[dependencies]
library = { git = "https://github.com/user/repo.git", tag = "v1.2.3" }
```

## Local Dependencies
```toml
[dependencies]
mylib = { path = "../local/path" }
```

# Build System

Zyn automatically:

- Detects header directories (`include/`, `Include/`)
- Generates appropriate compiler flags
- Supports CMake-based dependencies
- Maintains version locks in `.zyn/lock/`

# Best Practices

- Commit `zyn.toml` and `.zyn/lock/` to version control
- Use semantic versioning for tags
- Prefer tagged releases over branches
- Run `zyn update` periodically
